Dynamics-run tutorial
=====================

In this section, we describe how to use Perturbopy to process a Perturbo ``dynamics-run`` calculation.

The ultrafast dynamics calculation solves the real-time Boltzman transport equation (rt-BTE). Please see the `Perturbo website <https://perturbo-code.github.io/mmydoc_dynamics.html>`_ for more details.

We first run the Perturbo calculation following the instructions on the Perturbo website and obtain the YAML file, *'si_dynamics-run.yml'*. We also obtain two other important files: *'si_tet.h5'* (from the setup calculation), and *'si_cdyna.h5'*. These files store data on the k-points and the dynamics results which are too large to be outputted to the YAML file.

Next, we create the :py:class:`.DynaRun` object using the YAML file, cdyna HDF5 file, and tet HDF5 file as inputs. This :py:class:`.DynaRun` object contains all of the information from those three files.

.. code-block :: python

    import perturbopy.postproc as ppy

    cdyna_path = "si_cdyna.h5"
    tet_path = "si_tet.h5"
    yaml_path = "si_dynamics-run.yml"

    si_dyna_run = ppy.DynaRun.from_hdf5_yaml(cdyna_path, tet_path, yaml_path)


Accessing the data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can get a summary on the number of runs, (total number of performed simulations), the number of time steps and their increment for each run, and the electric field for each run.

.. code-block :: python

    si_dyna_run.get_info()

    >> This simulation has 1 runs
        
        Dynamics run: 1
        Number of steps: 25
        Time step (fs): 2.0
        Electric field (V/cm): [0. 0. 0.]

Individual runs
---------------

We can index the ``si_dyna_run`` object to obtain information on a particular run (stored in :py:class:`.DynaIndivRun` objects. For example, to obtain information on configuration 1:

.. code-block :: python

    # There was only one simulation in this run
    len(si_dyna_run)
    >> 1

    si_dyna_run[1]

.. note ::
    Indexing starts at 1 to be consistent with Perturbo indices.

For each run, we can obtain the distribution function at each time using the :py:attr:`DynaIndivRun.snap_t` attribute. The shape of this attribute is :math:`N_{bands} \times N_{kpoints} \times N_{\Delta t}`.

.. code-block :: python

    si_dyna_run[1].snap_t.shape # num_bands x num_kpoints x num_time_steps
    >> (2, 15975, 25)

    # Get the distribution function at band 1, k-point 1000, and all time steps.
    si_dyna_run[1].snap_t[1, 1000, :]

    si_dyna_run[1].time_step
    >> 2.0
    si_dyna_run[1].efield
    >> array([0., 0., 0.])


K-points
--------

The k-points used for the bands calculation are stored in the :py:attr:`.DynaRun.kpt` attribute, which is of type :py:class:`.RecipPtDB`. For example, to access the k-point coordinates and their units:

.. code-block :: python
    
    si_dyna_run.kpt.points[:, 0]

    >> array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5])

    si_dyna_run.kpt.units

    >> 'crystal'

Please see the section :ref:`handling_kpt_qpt` for more details on accessing information from :py:attr:`.DynaRun.kpt`, such as labeling the k-points and converting to Cartesian coordinates.

Band energies
-------------

The  band energies are stored in the :py:attr:`.DynaRun.bands` attribute, which is a :py:class:`.UnitsDict` object. The keys represent the band index, and the values are arrays containing the band energies corresponding to each k-point. 

.. code-block :: python

    si_dyna_run.bands.keys()
    >> dict_keys([1, 2])

    si_dyna_run.bands[2]
    >> array([0.51121006, 0.51080167, 0.51173707, ..., 0.50932315, 0.50955554, 0.51121006])

Please see the section :ref:`physical_quantities` for details on accessing the bands and their units.
